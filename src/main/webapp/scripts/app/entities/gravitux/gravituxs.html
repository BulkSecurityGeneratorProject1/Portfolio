        <h3>Info</h3>
        <p>GraviTux JS is a reimplementation of GraviTux in JavaScript. GraviTux is a Java game developed by fellow students and me back in 2012.<br />
            The Sourcecode of <a href="https://github.com/thinking-aloud/GraviTux/">GraviTux</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thinking-aloud/GraviTux_JS/">GraviTux JS</a> is available on GitHub.</p>
        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <p>You play as the linux mascot Tux in a penguin world and have to collect fish barrels. In order to succeed, you need to control the gravity.<br />
        You can run with W-A-S-D or the arrow keys. Use SPACE to swap gravity.<br />
        Have Fun!</p>
